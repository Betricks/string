# Description 

This repo contains string manipulation like adding two string charecters

```py
str1 = "Hello, "

str2 = "World!"

str1 + str2

"Hello, World!"
```

And also you Multiply string by number 

```py
str1 = "Hello, World! "

str1 = str1 * 3

"Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World!"
```

If you Multiply a string by 3 it takes The charecter and alocates 3 times
The Memory of the charecter, and pastes 3 times.
